Subject: [PATCH] Fix regression in QWaylandGlContext::makeCurrent for
 offscreen surfaces

[ChangeLog][QPA plugin] Fixed a bug where offscreen surfaces would get
surfaceless EGL contexts.

Fixes a regression in in bf09c7a1.

The call, window->updateSurface(window->isExposed()), is problematic because
offscreen textures are never exposed, and consequently, eglSurface will be
EGL_NO_SURFACE, which will then create a surfaceless context in the call:

    eglMakeCurrent(m_eglDisplay, eglSurface, eglSurface, m_context)

This reverts to the old behavior of always trying to create an EGL surface,
unless the window doesn't have a valid wl_surface, in which case it doesn't
make sense (which is what bf09c7a1 fixed, QTBUG-65553).
