SUMMARY = "IBM's Software TPM 2.0"
DESCRIPTION = "The software TPM 2.0 is targeted toward application development, \
education, and virtualization. \
\
The intent is that an application can be developed using the software TPM. \
The application should then run using a hardware TPM without changes. \
Advantages of this approach: \
* In contrast to a hardware TPM, it runs on many platforms and it's generally faster. \
* Application software errors are easily reversed by simply removing the TPM state and starting over. \
* Difficult crypto errors are quickly debugged by looking inside the TPM."
